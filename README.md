# What's this?
The High Performance Computing.pdf is a paper that me and my colleagues developed about the state of art of HPC during 
the curricular unit of High Performance Computing of my Bioinformatics degree.

In the second project of this curricular unit was asked to establish the communication betweeen two machines and to do 
that we used the *.java files available in this repository. We also had a task to explore some applications of the architecture
Client-Server and to exploit some of its disavantages and advantages. 

# What I've learned? 
HPC provides researchers the ability to expand their data processing, simulation and computation across hundreds of cores.
How the communications between two machines occur and also how HPC can be used in different field to provide a some advantages
in terms of data processing.
